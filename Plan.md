### Milestone A, Friday, Apr 7.

For Milestone A, Lara came up with the idea of analyzing music playlists and designed a few preliminary points and plans. The team discussed the idea and agreed. We designed a presentation slide before meeting with one of the TAs. Our framework will take in the playlists selected by the users, then process the playlist according to the tags and features, and will give outputs including various visualizations with details of the music: mood, artist (band), type of music, genres, etc. Lara took most of the charge of designing the slides and prepared the domain diagrams, Youwei sketched out the plans for three milestones and split the work, and wrote design documents according to the team discussion of the slides and the domain diagram. The team then discussed the design documents with the TA and revised them accordingly.

### Milestone B, Tuesday, Apr 18.

Over the weekend of Apr 7, We plan to implement the code skeleton of three data plugins. Each team member (Jiayue, Lara, and Youwei) will take charge of one of the data plugins planned, as well as the corresponding part of the UI implementation.

Internal deadlines:

By Apr 12 (last day of class before carnival), all three team members should have around 60% of work done.

Over the carnival break, each team member should work on and improve their own data plugin assigned, including the backend design and front-end UI implementation.

By Monday Apr 17, the individual coding should be done.

On Apr 18, final peer review of each other's work and code revision should be done.

### Milestone C, Friday, Apr 28.

From Apr 18 to Apr 28, we will write implementations for data plugins for other teams or support our framework if we are selected. Possible data plugins that others could implement for our framework include other music services such as YouTube Music, Pandora, etc. These music services tend to have similar algorithms for grouping their music playlists. Details of work TBD.
